# TabWatcher

When browsing websites it's still a painful task to wait for pages finish loading. Common cases are:

* uploading huge files or
* visiting busy websites (e.g. when buying tickets for a music festival that has just started pre-selling)

Instead of observing those pages to finish loading it might be more convenient to keep surfing and be informed just when the page finished loading.

TabWatcher is a Chrome expansion that was developed for this very purpose.
